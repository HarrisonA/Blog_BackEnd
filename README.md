# Blog_BackEnd
Blog Backend (API) built with Rails 5

NOTE: This app was built for the Blog_FrontEnd App (one of my other repos).

### To install this BACK end app:
(Ruby version 2.2 or higher, Rails 5 should be installed on your computer)

1. Clone this repo.  

2. cd into the "Blog_BackEnd" directory and run "bundle exec rake db:create", then "bundle exec rake db:migrate".  

3. Run "rails s" to start the Rails API server.

### TO INSTALL THE FRONT end app:
3. Clone my other repo titled "Blog_FrontEnd".  The instructions to install are in that repo's readme.  

Enjoy.

### NOTE:
The original purpose of this app was to quickly build a Rails 5 Backend that could communicate with an Ember 2.x frontend app. This app started from the tutorial: http://9elements.com/io/index.php/an-ember-js-application-with-a-rails-api-backend/.  FYI, I made quite a few changes from the original tutorial (JSONAPIAdapter, serializing, deserialzing, etc).

### Note: Styling, advance functionality, etc will be added at a later date. ###
